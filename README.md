# Password-Manager
NEW UPDATED PASSWORD MANAGER PROGRAM IS CAM-MANAGER-2.0

Basic Password Manager

Author: Cameron Wickersham

This program is pretty much the same as the other password manager I made
in C++ but I wanted to make a version using a GUI.
This python program utilizes tkinter and sqlite3 to make the program look nicer.

Tkinter is a module that specializes in GUIs that comes default with python.

Sqlite3 is a module that lets you build SQL databases with a lighter
load -- meaning you get enough functions to work with a SQL database but 
without all the 'beefy-ness' of a true SQL module.

I utilized Tkinter to build the main gui and display all the information 
within the program. Sqlite3 was used for data manipuation (duh).

The first program I wrote in C++ saved all the information in a file
that acted as a makeshift database. I wanted to challenge myself to learn
a little SQL and thus Sqlite3 was imported.

Cam_Manager.py is the source code for this project, while database_maker.py 
creates a new password database file. pass.db in the repository is a fresh file
made from database_maker.py.
